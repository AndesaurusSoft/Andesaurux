# Andesaurux
Unix-compatible free(as in freedom) kernel that will be fully open-source and free.
Goal:
  Light and fully FLOSS kernel for daily use
# Will it be based on Linux?
No, but it will also be Unix-compatible and i took some libraries from old Linux kernel.
# Will it be fully FLOSS?
Yes, i will not use proprietary firmware or make blobs, every line of code will be free.
# What about kernel? Is it monolithic or is it microkernel?
I think, i should make microkernel, because they are less complicated and if there's a bug, i will need to fix it in a server programm, not in the kernel
## Please, fork this repo as much as possible
### And make the Makefile for it ;)
