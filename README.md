# Andesaurux
Unix-compatible free(as in freedom) OS that will be fully open-source
and free. 
# Will it be based on Linux? 
No, but it will also be Unix-compatible and i took some libraries from old Linux kernel. 
# Will it be fully FLOSS? 
Yes, i will not use proprietary firmware or make blobs, every line of code will be free. \# What about kernel? Is it
monolithic or is it microkernel? I think, i should make microkernel, because they are less complicated and if there's a bug, i will need to fix it in a server programm, not in the kernel 
# My goals: 
Development of fully free OS, which will compatible with UNIX
Minimal resource consumption 
Maximum performance 
Hardware support
