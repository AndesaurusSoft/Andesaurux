So, you want an app that isn't included in Andesaurux?
Let's download them!
There are two ways:
Compile the source code of program
Use pkgm
pkgm(PacKaGe Manager) is package manager that automates the compilation of source code and if needed, installs the dependencies
To install a program, type: pkgm install <name>
To remove a program, type: pkgm remove <name>
To update the list of programs, type: pkgm update
To upgrade all the programs, type: pkgm upgrade
P.S. You need to be root to use pkgm.
