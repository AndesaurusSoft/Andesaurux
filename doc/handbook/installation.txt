So, you have downloaded and compiled Andesaurux, time to install it.
1.  Open ~/Andesaurux/binaries
2.  Create iso from that folder
3.  Write the iso to removable device through Etcher, or dd.
    Etcher is very simple, just select iso, device and press "Flash!"
    To write iso to device through dd, type "dd if=<path-to-iso> of=<device>"
    For example:
    dd if=andesaurux.iso of=/dev/sdb
4.  Shutdown your computer, plug-in the device with Andesaurux and boot from it
5.  Done! Now you will boot into Andesaurux. The init daemon will boot and it will boot Minian!
