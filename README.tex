Unix-compatible free(as in freedom) OS that will be fully open-source
and free. \# Will it be based on Linux? No, but it will also be
Unix-compatible and i took some libraries from old Linux kernel. \# Will
it be fully FLOSS? Yes, i will not use proprietary firmware or make
blobs, every line of code will be free. \# What about kernel? Is it
monolithic or is it microkernel? I think, i should make microkernel,
because they are less complicated and if there's a bug, i will need to
fix it in a server programm, not in the kernel \# My goals: Development
of fully free OS, which will compatible with UNIX(Mainly, FreeBSD)
Minimal resource consumption Maximum performance Support hardware
